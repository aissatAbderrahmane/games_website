# games_website
This project is one of our university project , made by me and 3 mates in 2018. 
:memo: I was in charge of the Back-End part : PHP/MySQL
:memo: this was a quick back-end that i made in the last day (4hr) of coding before exposing the project to our teacher.
:memo: it was fun to be able to code CRUD operations that quick at that time from scratch.
# About the Use:
:crayon: you are 100% free to use and edit the project.
:crayon: Note that the project has been directly uploaded no checks or fixing bugs or .... 
:crayon: the last thing i remember is: that there's some front-end footer display errors. Except that you're free to use it or suggest your fix.
Regards.
