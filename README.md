# Open Source Games Website Project
This project is one of our university project , made by me and 3 mates in 2018. 
:memo: I was in charge of the Back-End part : PHP/MySQL.

:memo: this was a quick back-end that i made in the last day (4hr) of coding before exposing the project to our teacher.

:memo: it was fun to be able to code CRUD operations that quick at that time from scratch.

# About the Use:
:crayon: you are 100% free to use and edit the project.

:crayon: Note that the project has been directly uploaded no checks or fixing bugs or .... 

:crayon: the last thing i remember is: that there's some front-end footer display errors. Except that you're free to use it or suggest your fix.

Regards.
